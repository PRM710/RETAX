# üßæ Next.js Invoice Project

This project displays a simple **invoice page** using **Next.js 16** with data fetched from a public API.  
It also includes a **Print Invoice** feature that allows users to select 1, 2, or 3 copies before printing.  

---

##  Features

- Built with **Next.js (App Router)**  
- Uses **fetch API** for data integration  
- No use of `useState`, `useEffect`, or Context API  
- Clean and professional bill-like layout  
- Supports printing multiple copies directly from the browser

##  API Used

The project uses mock invoice data hosted on **myjson.online**:

 **API URL:** [https://myjson.online/api/quick/a6274d23-cd8d-484c-9ad1-7b1981fa014d](https://myjson.online/api/quick/a6274d23-cd8d-484c-9ad1-7b1981fa014d)

### API Data Format
```json
[
  {
    "invoice_number": 1,
    "client_name": "PRAKASH MANE",
    "date": "26/10/2025",
    "amount": "‚Çπ500",
    "description": "food for prakash"
  }
]
```

This mock API was created using **https://myjson.online/** to simulate a backend response.
